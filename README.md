# SOLID Principles

### The SOLID principles are a set of guidelines for writing good, maintainable code. Here is a brief explanation of each principle in the context of Swift:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class or module should have only one responsibility. In Swift, this means that a class should only have one reason to change.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, you should be able to add new functionality to a class without changing its existing code.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types. In Swift, this means that any subclass should be able to be used in place of its parent class without causing unexpected behavior.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. In Swift, this means that you should define smaller protocols instead of large ones that include methods that aren't needed.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Instead, both should depend on abstractions. In Swift, this means that you should use protocols to define interfaces between classes, instead of relying on concrete implementations.
